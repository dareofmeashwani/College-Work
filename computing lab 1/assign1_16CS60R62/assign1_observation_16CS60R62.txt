Observations:

1. By executing the program on the sample input files provided in serial mode it takes 0.2369 seconds.

2. In parallel mode i.e. k child processes are dividing the work and doing the task in parallel then the time take is greater than what was taken in the serial mode for any value of k > 2.

3. As the value of k is incereased the time taken increases.

Reasons for larger time taken in the second case:

1. Dividing the task i.e. words in the file is divided among different child processes.  
	
2. Merging the results of the child processes.
